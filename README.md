# Stratigraphy
The objective of the task is to create a stratigraphy data with a defined schema sorted by measured depth (md). We need to generate an output file by making use of
properties present in two jason files: stratigraphy.json and wellpath.json file. Tasks to be performed:

● In the ​output file​, wherever ​'base'​appears in the ​pickName ​ property (present in stratigraphy.json​), rename the ​pickName ​ to ​'undifferentiated'​ .

● md(measured depth)​and ​tvd(true vertical depth)​should be in meters (unit). ​md ​ is represented as ​md ​ or ​pickDepth ​in both of the files.


The pythod code file contains the code required the perform the above mentioned task.
The final_out.json file contains final result after completion of the task.
